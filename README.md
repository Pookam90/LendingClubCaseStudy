### Background:
Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. There are two types of risks associated with the bank’s decision:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed

The primary objective of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in minimizing the credit losses and identify the potential factors for defaulting.
